# About Me

I am an IT expert with heart and mind, bringing 35 years of professional experience to the table. Together with a friend, I founded ilink 35 years ago, where I am now the managing director. My passion lies in integrating existing software and optimizing business processes.

## Focus Areas
- **Software Integration:** Connecting existing systems to streamline processes.
- **Project Management:** Planning and managing complex projects.
- **Training on the Job:** Knowledge transfer during project work.
- **Operation and Support:** Organizing operations, including according to BSI IT baseline protection standards.

## Key Skills
- **Team Building:** People with diverse perspectives come together to form a team that works in unison toward a common goal.
- **Empathy:** It is important to channel the diverse needs and challenges of teams into effective collaboration, leveraging them to develop suitable solutions. This is the focus of my work.
- **Experience:** Extensive work in the ECMA committee on the CSTA standard.
- **Commitment:** Chair of the DNUG working group for communication, chat, and web meetings, and an HCL Ambassador.

## My Vision
Beyond successfully managing projects, I ensure that participants acquire the necessary skills during the process. My approach emphasizes "training on the job"â€”explaining every step to empower customers to maintain and enhance their systems independently after project completion.

For example, I have enabled customers with no prior knowledge of Linux, containers, or MongoDB to gain the confidence and ability to use these technologies autonomously.
